# Predictive Parser - CPSC 323 Project 2

This program implements a predictive table-driven parser for arithmetic expressions using a manually constructed parsing table. It is based on the grammar and table provided in Question 7 of Project 2.

## Features

- Accepts input strings ending with `$` (end-of-input symbol).
- Displays the parsing stack, input, and parsing action at each step.
- Handles correct grammar and detects errors using predictive parsing logic.
